  \Abstract{
  This thesis proposes an approach to automate parts of the security and compliance check process for software systems. The proof of concept implementation of the Security Compliance Automation Tool (SecurityCAT) aims to simplify this process by providing a decoupled set of microservices capable of automatically evaluating the compliance state of centrally managed requirements.
  
  The root element of the testing system is OWASP's Security Requirement Automation Tool (SecurityRAT), which serves as a single point of truth for the mentioned compliance of the managed requirements. This interface triggers all interaction with the automation system.
  
  Three microservices for security and compliance testing have been implemented to test both, the infrastructure level, using Azure Policies, and the application level, using the ZAP Proxy and a custom response checking script. Each is focusing on another aspect of security testing.
  
  Given the nearly infinite attack space of an application, drawbacks surface upon testing of the proposed microservices. A skin-deep analysis gives insights into which implementation shows potential for further investigation.
